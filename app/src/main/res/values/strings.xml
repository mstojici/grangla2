    <string name="help_text">Try to collect four symbols in a row. Whoever does that more often wins. You get the right to make the next move after a certain amount of time since your last one has expired. The game gets faster as it approaches the end. Do not make excess moves because you lose your symbols if you put too many on the board. To play against player on other device use QR codes to connect via WiFi hotspot. Have fun!</string>
